The following metadata fields are recommended for all airway epithelial cell–based assays to ensure reproducibility and cross-study interoperability.								
Each factor represents a critical determinant of epithelial differentiation status and assay response:								
								
Donor anatomical region: distinguishes proximal vs. distal (nose vs. large vs. small) airway origin, which influences ion transport and mucin expression.								
Donor passage number: indicates cell senescence and differentiation potential; CFTR and ASL metrics vary with passage.								
Differentiation medium formulation: growth factor and supplement composition strongly affect CFTR, ENaC, and mucociliary phenotypes.								
Substrate type (membrane and coating): membrane material and ECM coatings alter cell attachment, polarity, differentiation, morphology, and ion permeability.								
Days at ALI: reflects culture maturity and functional stability; critical for comparing TEER, CFTR function, and ASL height between studies.								
								
These variables define the biological and experimental context necessary for interpreting assay outcomes and for ontology-based data harmonization within the Source-to-Outcome (S2O) data standards framework.
