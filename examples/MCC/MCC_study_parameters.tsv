Common_Inputs	Cell type (primary human/bronchial airway epithelial cells, porcine airway epithelial cells); Number of cell donors; Replicates per donor; Days at ALI (4-8 weeks); Tissue type (cultured vs ex vivo); Disease state (CF, healthy); Anatomical location; Culture substrate (Millicell culture insert, 0.4 µm pore polyester supports coated with type I collagen); Culture medium (PneumaCult Ex Plus, PneumaCult ALI); Culture temperature (37°C); Culture gas (CO2, 0.05%); Apical wash protocol (PBS, frequency, temperature)
Common_Exposure	Fluorescent tracers (fluorescent microspheres, SPY650-tubulin); Bacterial biofilms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 strain); Viral infection (SARS-CoV-2 fluorescent reporter virus, MOI ~0.5, 5×10⁵ PFU); Cell stains (CellMask Orange, NucView 530, phalloidin for actin, acetyl α-tubulin for cilia, MUC5AC for mucus); Mucolytics; CFTR modulators; Matrix patterning (collagen coating with directional ridges); Agarose overlay (1% low melting temperature); Initial infection incubation (28°C, 1 hour, intermittent rocking)
Common_Outputs	Mucociliary transport rate (µm/s or mm/min, mean and SD of tracked particles); Mucus transport distance over time; Transport directionality; Ciliary beat frequency (Hz) over time; Ciliary beat surface area (% of culture area); ASL and PCL depths (µm); Mucus layer thickness; Biofilm clearance rate; Bacterial load (CFU); Viral spread rate (GFP+ spots per hour, mm/hour); Infection sites over time; Ciliary orientation distribution; Videos (time-lapse, longitudinal up to 12 days post-infection)
