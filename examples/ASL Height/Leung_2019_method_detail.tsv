Assay	Intranasal micro-Optical Coherence Tomography (μOCT) imaging
Endpoint	ASL depth (µm); PCL depth (µm); Ciliary beat frequency (Hz); Mucociliary transport rate (mm/min)
Specific assay/protocol	Minimally invasive, non-contact optical imaging using micro-OCT with ~1-2 µm axial resolution for simultaneous multi-parameter acquisition of ASL, PCL, CBF, and MCT in same field of view
Inputs	Ex vivo human nasal tissue samples; In vivo human subjects (healthy controls and CF patients); Clinical-grade μOCT probe for intranasal use; Anatomical site: nasal region (inferior turbinate typical); Micron-scale calibration phantom with known layer thicknesses
Outputs	Cross-sectional OCT images (B-scans); Depth-resolved tissue structure; Temporal image sequences for dynamic measurements; ASL depth (µm) from layer segmentation; PCL depth (µm) from layer segmentation; CBF (Hz) from temporal analysis; MCT rate (mm/min) from tracking mucus movement
Measured	Optical interferometry: Light backscattering from tissue layers; Depth profile from refractive index changes at tissue interfaces; Temporal signals from moving structures (cilia, mucus); Frame rate: >20 fps for capturing ciliary motion
Derived	ASL height: Distance between epithelial surface and upper mucus boundary from segmented OCT images. PCL depth: Distance between epithelial surface and mucus layer (may require contrast enhancement). CBF: Frequency analysis of temporal pixel intensity variations in ciliary region using Fast Fourier Transform or autocorrelation. MCT rate: Displacement of mucus particles/features over time converted to velocity (mm/min).
Method Details	"System Configuration: Micro-OCT system with ~1-2 µm axial resolution and ~2-4 µm lateral resolution. Swept-source or spectral-domain OCT optimized for superficial airway imaging. Miniaturized probe design for intranasal access. Imaging Protocol: Probe positioned in nasal cavity (typically inferior turbinate) under direct visualization or endoscopic guidance. Non-contact imaging maintained 1-3 mm working distance from tissue surface. Cross-sectional images (B-scans) acquired at 20-100 frames per second for dynamic measurements. Imaging depth: 1-2 mm penetration into tissue. M-mode imaging at fixed location for CBF and MCT quantification. Environmental Control: Imaging performed at room temperature or with temperature monitoring. Humidity of nasal environment naturally maintained in vivo. Subject breathing pattern monitored; imaging during breath-hold or controlled breathing to reduce motion artifacts. Image Acquisition: Multiple sites imaged per subject (typically 3-5 locations in nasal cavity). Duration per imaging site: 30-60 seconds for adequate sampling. Image sequences stored for offline analysis. Calibration: System calibrated with micron-scale phantom (known layer thicknesses) before and after imaging sessions. Refractive index correction applied (n = 1.33-1.40 for aqueous layers)."
Biological	"Cell Types/Tissue: Nasal respiratory epithelium (ciliated columnar epithelium); Goblet cells (mucus-secreting); Submucosal structures. Subject Characteristics - Healthy Controls: Age range typically adults 18-65 years; No history of chronic respiratory disease; Non-smokers or specified smoking history. Subject Characteristics - CF Patients: Confirmed CF diagnosis (genetic testing); Genotype documented (F508del homozygous, heterozygous, or other mutations); Clinical status (FEV1, medication regimen, CFTR modulator therapy); Age-matched to controls when possible. Anatomical Region: Inferior turbinate (most common site); Middle turbinate; Nasal floor or septum. Physiological Conditions In Vivo: Physiological temperature (~34-37°C in nasal cavity); Natural humidity and ion composition; Normal breathing or controlled breath-hold; No topical anesthesia typically required."
Technical/structural	"μOCT System Specifications: Light Source - Swept-source laser or superluminescent diode (center wavelength typically 840 nm or 1300 nm). Axial Resolution: 1-2 µm (in tissue). Lateral Resolution: 2-4 µm. Imaging Speed: 20-100 frames per second. Imaging Depth: 1-2 mm. Sensitivity: >90 dB. Probe Design: Miniaturized endoscopic probe (2-3 mm diameter); Rigid or flexible configuration for nasal access; Working distance: 1-3 mm; Field of view: 1-3 mm (lateral). Image Processing: Real-time image reconstruction; Motion artifact detection and correction algorithms; Automated or semi-automated layer segmentation; Frequency analysis for CBF extraction."

Assumptions	"Optical Assumptions: Refractive index of ASL assumed ~1.33 (aqueous); Refractive index of tissue ~1.40; Scattering from ASL-mucus interface sufficient for boundary detection. Physiological Assumptions: Nasal epithelium representative of lower airway function in CF; ASL properties measured in nasal cavity correlate with tracheobronchial ASL; Short-term imaging does not significantly perturb normal mucociliary function. Technical Assumptions: Motion artifacts can be adequately corrected or avoided through breath-holding; Probe positioning maintained stable during imaging period; Sufficient image quality for automated boundary detection. Biological Assumptions: Ciliary beat and mucociliary transport continue normally during non-contact imaging; No significant evaporation during brief in vivo imaging; Natural mucus properties preserved during imaging."
