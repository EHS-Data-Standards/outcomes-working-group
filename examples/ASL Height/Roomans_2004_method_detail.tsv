Endpoint	ASL height (µm); Mucus transport rate (distance/time); Ion concentrations (mM) for Cl⁻, Na⁺, and other elements
Specific assay/protocol	Three complementary methods: (1) XZ confocal microscopy for ASL height with fluorescent dextran labeling, (2) Epifluorescence microscopy with 1 µm fluorescent microspheres for mucus transport tracking, (3) X-ray microanalysis of frozen hydrated airways or ion-exchange beads for elemental composition
Inputs	Primary airway cells seeded on 12-mm diameter Corning-Costar Transwell Collagen T-cols inserts; Fluorescent probes (Texas Red-dextran 10 kDa, Oregon green-dextran, BCECF-dextran, SNARF-dextran); 100 nm fluorescent microspheres for mucus; 1 µm fluorescent microspheres for transport; Perfluorocarbons (FC-72, FC-77); Test compounds (amiloride, ATP); Sephadex G-25 beads (20-40 µm); Animal trachea/bronchi; Human nasal fluid; Cultured airway epithelial cells (liquid-liquid or air-liquid interface); Silicon oil; Liquid propane and nitrogen; Reference standards (frozen salt solutions 50-250 mM, serum, plasma)
Outputs	ASL height (7-70 µm range); PCL and mucus layer delineation; XZ confocal images; Mucus transport linear velocity; Angular velocity; Distance traveled in 5 seconds; Epifluorescence images with microsphere streaks; Videos of mucociliary clearance; Ion concentrations in mM (Cl⁻: 18-140 mM, Na⁺); X-ray microanalysis spectra; Ratio of characteristic to continuum intensity
Measured	ASL height: Direct measurement of fluorescent probe layer height in XZ confocal images; microsphere-free region (PCL); microsphere-containing region (mucus). Mucus transport: Length of fluorescent streak in 5-second exposure; position changes in sequential images. Ion composition: X-ray emission spectra from samples; characteristic and continuum X-ray intensities for specific elements.
Derived	ASL volume (indexed by height); Changes in ASL height over time; Baseline vs post-treatment heights. Mucus transport: Linear velocity = streak length / 5 seconds; angular velocity from radial patterns; normalized transport rates (at 1 mm from center). Ion composition: Ion concentrations from ratio of characteristic to continuum intensity; quantification by comparison to standard calibration curves.
Method Details	"Cell Culture: Seed primary airway cells directly onto 12-mm diameter inserts (Corning-Costar Transwell Collagen T-cols) at 2.5×10⁵ cells/cm². Confluence in 3-5 days, then air-liquid interface (culture medium omitted from mucosal surface). Over ~2 weeks form layer of 70% ciliated cells and 30% goblet cells over basal cells. Prewash cultures to remove excess ASL/mucus; add fluorescent probes either with final wash (aspirate to minimal levels) or in 20-50 µl bolus left for >2 days. Leave in 100% humidified incubator between readings. Label ASL with Texas Red-10 kDa dextran (epithelium-impermeable) or Oregon green-dextran. Label mucus with 100 nm fluorescent microspheres. Add perfluorocarbons (PFCs) to mucosal surface during measurements to prevent evaporation. FC-72 (boiling point 56°C) applied before compound addition for baseline heights; FC-77 (boiling point 97°C) added after compound addition. Compounds (amiloride, ATP) added as dry powders suspended in FC-72 PFC. XZ Confocal: Use inverted microscopes with 1.2 NA water immersion lenses to image from below cultures. Oil lenses alternative but smaller working distance. Cultures on coverslip in heated or unheated chamber. Mucus Transport: Add 1 µm fluorescent microspheres to cultures; partition into mucus layer. Real-time imaging using inverted epifluorescence microscope with 5× dry lens and CCD camera. 5-second exposure images; streak length = transport distance in 5 s. Alternative: sequential imaging with high-speed CCD for videos. Ion Composition (Frozen Airways): Remove trachea/bronchi from anesthetized animals; dissect in humidified chamber. Freeze in liquid propane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Place on specimen holder (mucosal side up or sideways); transfer at liquid nitrogen temperature to SEM with cold stage at −190°C. Coat with thin carbon layer on cold stage. Analyze at 9-10 kV accelerating voltage; 8-10 analyses per sample for 500 s with 200 nm beam. Ion Composition (Beads from Trachea): Spread Sephadex G-25 beads (20-40 µm) on dissected trachea; leave 10-30 min in humidified chamber. Recover by flushing with hydrophobic volatile silicon oil. Remove adhering fluid and debris; transfer single beads to nylon grids submerged in oil. Remove mucus from beads. Lift grid from oil-bath; mount on aluminum holder with carbon tape. Leave at room temperature until oil evaporates. Carbon coat. X-ray microanalysis at 20 kV for 100 s with 100 nm beam; 10-12 beads per sample. Human Nasal Fluid: Apply beads on double-sided tape on filter paper (2×2 mm²); insert into nostril 10-20 min (longer for CF). Wash in silicon oil; separate and move to nylon EM grid; process as above. Liquid-Liquid Interface Cultures: Grow cells on membrane inserts in 24-well chamber 4-7 days to confluence (≥400 Ω·cm²). Cover with PBS layer 24 h. Freeze entire culture in liquid propane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Transfer to SEM with cold stage and analyze. Alternative: place beads on culture 20 min. Air-Liquid Interface Cultures: Grow as liquid-liquid first; remove culture medium from apical surface. Culture 1 month; wash apical surface with PBS twice a week. Add Sephadex-G25 beads to ASL; equilibrate 20 min. Transfer to grids and analyze."

Technical/structural	"ASL structure: Two-phase system with (1) Mucus layer (upper) trapping particles/bacteria and (2) Periciliary liquid layer (PCL, lower) lubricating mucus. ASL height range: 7-70 µm. Microsphere-free region = PCL; microsphere-containing region = mucus. Culture system: Semi-permeable T-col insert with basal cells (bottom), ciliated cells (70%) and goblet cells (30%) at mucosal surface, mucus layer (ML) on top, PCL between cilia and mucus. Transport: Mucus moves as single network with radial pattern; can exhibit rotational transport; linear velocity increases with distance from center. Function: Airway cultures are Na⁺/volume absorbing (like proximal airways in vivo); absorb excess ASL over time; well-differentiated cultures coordinate ciliary beating for spontaneous mucus transport."
Equipment	"Microscopy: Inverted confocal microscopes with 1.2 NA water immersion lenses (or oil lenses, or 0.7 NA dipping/dry lenses). Alternative: upright microscopes with dipping/dry lenses. Conventional inverted epifluorescence microscope with 5× dry lens and CCD camera (color or B&W). High-speed CCD camera for videos. Heated chambers (World Precision Instruments) or unheated (Molecular Probes). Coverslip-mounted chambers. X-ray Microanalysis: SEM with cold stage (−190°C), energy-dispersive spectrometer, carbon coating on cold stage. Operating: 9-10 kV (frozen), 20 kV (beads), 200 nm beam (frozen), 100 nm (beads), 500 s (frozen), 100 s (beads). Aluminum specimen holders, nylon grids, carbon adhesive tape. Sample Prep: Liquid nitrogen, liquid propane freezing, humidified chamber, preparation microscope, watch glass, vacuum pipette. Culture: 12-mm Corning-Costar Transwell Collagen T-cols, 24-well chambers, 100% humidified incubator, transepithelial resistance measurement. Other: Jet milling, syringe, filter paper."
Assumptions	"ASL height as volume index assumes height correlates with volume. Texas Red-dextran (10 kDa) relatively impermeable across epithelium (no significant probe loss). Microspheres partition into mucus layer selectively. PFCs prevent evaporation without altering ASL composition or cellular function. Entire mucus layer moves as single network (validated observation). Microsphere movement reflects true mucus movement. Beads saturate with salt solution within ~5 min (equilibration complete). Beads accurately capture ASL composition without altering it. Mucus-free beads give accurate readings. Air-liquid interface cultures recapitulate in vivo airway epithelial morphology and behave similarly to native airways. Cultures are predominantly Na⁺/volume absorbing like proximal airways in vivo. Rapid freezing preserves native ASL composition without ice crystal artifacts. Analysis at −190°C maintains sample integrity. Ratio of characteristic to continuum intensity for quantification; comparison to standards provides accurate absolute concentrations. Beads soaked in reference solutions are valid calibration. 8-10 analyses (frozen) or 10-12 beads are representative. Single point bead measurements reflect bulk composition. Temperature (room or 37°C) doesn't significantly affect ASL properties during measurement periods."
