Assay	Automated ASL height measurement by confocal microscopy
Endpoint	ASL Height (micrometers)
Specific assay/protocol	Automatic ASL measurement using automated stage confocal microscope with automatic image analysis software
Inputs	XZ confocal microscopy images of fluorescent-labeled ASL; Primary human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) at air-liquid interface; PBS (20 µl) with 0.5 mg/ml of 10 kDa dextran-tetramethylrhodamine (Life Technologies, D-1817); Perfluorocarbon (3M Fluorient FC-770) to prevent ASL evaporation
Outputs	ASL height measurements in micrometers; IC50 for SPLUNC1 (6.53 µM); Time course data for ASL absorption; Dose response curves; Difference in ASL height between normal and CF HBECs
Measured	ASL height measured from XZ-scanned fluorescent images using automatic image analysis. Images acquired at ~1 image/second. Software analyzes images at ~32 ms/image using Otsu's threshold for adaptive binarization, morphological operations for noise reduction, histogram analysis for boundary detection, five-point moving average for noise elimination, and seven-point filtering for edge detection. Upper and lower ASL boundaries detected by histogram profiling with 0.5 threshold. Image divided into horizontal subsections (8, 16, 32, 64, or 128) for varying boundary analysis.
Derived	ASL height calculated as average across multiple subsections. IC50 derived from dose-response curve fitting. Time-course trends calculated from serial measurements. Differences between normal and CF calculated by statistical comparison.
Method Details	"Human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs) were obtained from freshly excised bronchial specimens from normal and CF subjects (n ≥ 4 donors for each type) and were harvested by enzymatic digestion as previously described under a protocol approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board. HBECs were cultured at an air-liquid interface in a modified bronchial epithelial growth medium with 5% CO2 at 37°C and were used 3-4 wk after the seeding on 12-mm T-clear inserts (Corning-Costar, Corning, NY). During image acquisition, HBECs were maintained in a modified Ringer solution. ASL labeling: PBS (20 µl) with 0.5 mg/ml of 10 kDa dextran-tetramethylrhodamine was added to each culture. Perfluorocarbon (3M Fluorient FC-770) was added apically to prevent ASL evaporation. Images were obtained in XZ-scanning mode. SPLUNC1 time course and dose response: HBECS cultured at air-liquid interface for 3-4 wk. At 24 h before experiment, apical mucus removed by washing mucosal surface with PBS for 30 min at 37°C. For SPLUNC1 exposures, endogenous SPLUNC1 removed 2 h before experiment by incubating HBECs' apical surfaces with PBS at 37°C for 30 min, after which all additional PBS aspirated away. For time-course experiments, 10 µM SPLUNC1 and dextran-tetramethylrhodamine in PBS added apically, and ASL height measured immediately and at additional timed intervals with cultures returned to 37°C incubator between time points. For dose-response experiment, 0.1-100 µM SPLUNC1 in PBS added apically and cultures incubated at 37°C for 4 h and ASL heights then measured. Recombinant human SPLUNC1 purified from Escherichia coli. In some cases, cultures preloaded with dextran-tetramethylrhodamine 24 h earlier, and then on day of experiment 300 µM ATP added as dry powder suspended in perfluorocarbon."
Biological	"Cell type: Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Donors: Normal subjects (n≥4) and CF subjects (n≥4). Culture: Air-liquid interface in modified bronchial epithelial growth medium with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Substrate: 12-mm T-clear inserts (Corning-Costar, Corning, NY). Differentiation time: 3-4 weeks after seeding. Imaging conditions: Maintained in modified Ringer solution during image acquisition."
Technical/structural	Image size: 512×512 pixels corresponding to 145 µm². ASL heights varied from very narrow to very wide. Fluorescent ASL images obtained by XZ scanning. Automatic image processing uses: (1) Otsu's threshold for adaptive binarization to obtain foreground (ASL region) vs background, (2) Morphological operations to smooth boundaries, (3) Histogram analysis of horizontal subsections, (4) Five-point moving average preprocessing to eliminate noisy bounce, (5) Seven-point filtering for rising edge [−1 −1 −1 −1 1 1 1] and falling edge [1 1 1 −1 −1 −1 −1] detection. Subsections: tested with 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 horizontal divisions. Histogram profile threshold: 0.5 midrange value to determine upper and lower boundaries.
Equipment	Fully automated confocal microscope with automated stage; Custom automatic image analysis software; Image processing derived from computer science field; Modified Ringer solution chamber; 37°C incubator with 5% CO2
Assumptions	ASL height reflects hydration state of ASL. Dextran-tetramethylrhodamine labels ASL but is epithelium-impermeable. Perfluorocarbon prevents evaporation without affecting ASL properties. SPLUNC1 acts as epithelial sodium channel inhibitor. Statistical analyses: D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test performed; nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's test for multiple comparisons used since not all ASL height data sets normally distributed. P ≤ 0.05 considered statistically significant.
