Measured	Ussing Chamber: Short-circuit current (Isc) measured continuously under voltage-clamp conditions. Transepithelial resistance measured. CFTR current isolated by sequential additions: baseline, amiloride (block ENaC), forskolin + IBMX (activate CFTR), VX-770 (potentiate CFTR), CFTRinh-172 (block CFTR). Confocal Microscopy: XZ optical sections of fluorescent dextran-labeled ASL. ASL height measured from epithelial surface to upper ASL boundary. Multiple fields per culture. Baseline measurements before treatment and serial measurements after VX-770 exposure.
Derived	CFTR-mediated current: Calculated as forskolin-stimulated current inhibited by CFTRinh-172. VX-770 potentiation: Increase in CFTR current above forskolin baseline, expressed as fold-change or percent increase. ASL height changes: Difference between baseline and post-VX-770 ASL height, normalized to baseline. Correlation coefficient: Pearson or Spearman correlation between CFTR current magnitude and ASL height. EC50: Half-maximal effective concentration for VX-770 calculated from dose-response curve fitting. Functional rescue: Comparison of treated CF cells to untreated CF and wild-type controls.
Method Details	"Cell Culture: Primary human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from CF patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation and from non-CF controls. Cells expanded in culture then seeded on permeable membrane supports (Costar Snapwell or Transwell inserts, 12 mm diameter). Cultured at air-liquid interface for 3-4 weeks to achieve differentiated, polarized epithelium with ciliated and secretory cells. Culture medium: Airway epithelial growth medium; basolateral medium changed every 2-3 days; apical surface washed weekly with PBS to remove accumulated mucus. Ussing Chamber Protocol: Cultures mounted in modified Ussing chambers. Bathed in Ringer solution (basolateral and apical). Temperature maintained at 37°C. Transepithelial voltage clamped to 0 mV. Short-circuit current (Isc) recorded continuously. Protocol: (1) Baseline Isc recorded; (2) Amiloride (100 µM) added to apical side to block ENaC; (3) Forskolin (10 µM) + IBMX (100 µM) added to basolateral side to elevate cAMP and activate CFTR; (4) VX-770 added (concentration range 0.1-10 µM) to basolateral or apical side; (5) CFTRinh-172 (10 µM) added to apical side to confirm CFTR-mediated current. VX-770 Treatment for ASL Measurements: Cultures treated with VX-770 (typically 1-10 µM) in basolateral medium for defined periods (1-24 hours). Vehicle controls (DMSO) included. ASL Height Measurement: ASL labeled by adding small volume of PBS containing fluorescent dextran (10 kDa, Texas Red or similar) to apical surface. Perfluorocarbon (FC-77) added to prevent evaporation during imaging. Confocal microscopy in XZ mode to acquire vertical optical sections. Multiple fields (5-10) imaged per culture at each timepoint. Baseline ASL height measured before VX-770 treatment. Serial measurements at defined intervals after VX-770 addition (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 hours). Image analysis performed manually or with semi-automated software to determine ASL height from epithelial surface to ASL-air interface. Data Analysis: CFTR currents analyzed as peak response to each agent. ASL heights averaged across multiple fields per culture. Statistical comparisons: CF vs CF+VX-770 vs wild-type. Correlation analysis: CFTR current magnitude vs ASL height within and across genotypes. Dose-response analysis: Fit to sigmoidal or Hill equation to determine EC50."

Assumptions	"CFTR Function: F508del-CFTR retains residual function that can be potentiated; VX-770 acts specifically on CFTR channel gating; CFTRinh-172 selectively inhibits CFTR with minimal off-target effects. Electrophysiology: Short-circuit current accurately reflects transepithelial ion transport; Amiloride-sensitive current represents ENaC activity; Forskolin/IBMX-stimulated, CFTRinh-172-sensitive current is CFTR-mediated; Voltage clamp maintains uniform transepithelial voltage. ASL Measurements: Fluorescent dextran distributes uniformly in ASL without altering properties; Perfluorocarbon prevents evaporation without affecting ASL biology; ASL height reflects ASL volume and hydration status; Short-term imaging does not perturb CFTR function. Correlation: Increased CFTR-mediated chloride secretion leads to increased ASL volume; ASL height correlates with functional mucociliary clearance; Cultured cells recapitulate in vivo CFTR function and ASL regulation. VX-770 Mechanism: VX-770 increases CFTR open probability (gating); Effect is rapid and reversible; Dose-response relationship follows typical pharmacological principles (Hill equation)."
