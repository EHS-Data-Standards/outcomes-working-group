Endpoint	ASL depth (µm); PCL depth (µm); Ciliary beat frequency (Hz); Mucociliary transport velocity (mm/min); Tissue microstructure
Specific assay/protocol	Non-contact, cross-sectional imaging using μOCT with ~1-2 µm axial resolution for simultaneous measurement of ASL height, ciliary beat frequency, and mucociliary transport within same field of view
Inputs	Primary human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) cultured at air-liquid interface; Ex vivo airway tissue; μOCT system with ~1-2 µm axial resolution; Calibration phantom with micron-scale features verified pre/post imaging; Differentiation medium; Culture substrate (permeable membrane inserts)
Outputs	Cross-sectional OCT images (B-scans); ASL depth measurements (µm); PCL depth measurements (µm); Ciliary beat frequency (Hz) from motion analysis; Mucociliary transport velocity (mm/min); Tissue microstructure visualization; Depth-resolved functional maps
Measured	Optical coherence tomography interferometry measuring light backscattering from tissue layers and fluid interfaces. Real-time cross-sectional imaging with depth resolution. Motion patterns from ciliary beating detected in temporal image sequences. Mucus displacement tracked over time in M-mode or sequential B-scans.
Derived	ASL depth: Distance from epithelial surface to upper mucus boundary calculated from segmented layer boundaries in OCT images. PCL depth: Distance from epithelial surface to lower mucus boundary. CBF: Dominant frequency extracted from temporal intensity fluctuations in ciliary region using Fourier analysis. MCT velocity: Rate of mucus displacement calculated from particle/feature tracking across sequential frames, converted to mm/min.
Method Details	"Culture Preparation: Primary human airway epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface on permeable membrane inserts. Differentiation period to achieve mature ciliated phenotype with coordinated beating and mucus production. Days at ALI documented for each culture. μOCT Imaging: Non-contact imaging performed with probe positioned above culture surface. Working distance maintained at 1-3 mm. System provides ~1-2 µm axial resolution for resolving thin fluid layers. Lateral resolution ~2-4 µm. Cross-sectional images (B-scans) acquired at high frame rates (20-100 fps) for dynamic measurements. M-mode imaging (single A-line repeated over time) used for CBF and MCT quantification. Imaging depth: 1-2 mm penetration. Environmental Control: Cultures maintained at 37°C during imaging when possible, or room temperature with documentation. Humidity controlled to prevent evaporation. Chamber may be sealed or use humidified airflow. Calibration: System calibrated before and after imaging sessions using phantom with known layer thicknesses (typically glass coverslips or polymer films). Refractive index corrections applied (n = 1.33 for aqueous ASL, n = 1.40 for tissue). Image Analysis: Automated or semi-automated segmentation algorithms applied to detect layer boundaries (epithelial surface, ASL-mucus interface). CBF extracted by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or autocorrelation of temporal intensity variations. MCT calculated from displacement of scattering features or particles in mucus layer over defined time intervals. Multiple regions of interest analyzed per culture. Statistical analysis: Mean and standard deviation calculated from multiple measurements per culture and across cultures."
Biological	"Cell Type: Primary human airway epithelial cells (ciliated columnar epithelium, goblet cells, basal cells). Culture System: Air-liquid interface on permeable membrane inserts (e.g., Transwell, Snapwell). Differentiation: 2-4 weeks at ALI to achieve mature mucociliary phenotype. Culture Conditions: Maintained in defined airway epithelial growth medium; basolateral medium replaced regularly; apical surface kept dry (air-exposed) except for native ASL production. Quality Control: Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) monitored; ciliary beating confirmed visually; mucus production verified. Donor Information: Human bronchial or tracheal epithelial cells from lung donors or surgical specimens; donor characteristics documented (age, disease status). Ex Vivo Tissue: Fresh airway tissue from animals or human surgical specimens; tissue viability maintained during imaging."
Technical/structural	"μOCT System: Spectral-domain or swept-source OCT configuration. Light source: Superluminescent diode or swept laser (typical wavelengths 840 nm or 1300 nm). Axial resolution: ~1-2 µm in tissue. Lateral resolution: ~2-4 µm. Imaging speed: 20-100 kHz A-scan rate. Sensitivity: >90 dB. Imaging depth: 1-2 mm. Probe Configuration: Free-space beam delivery or fiber-optic probe. Scanning mechanism: Galvanometer mirrors or MEMS scanner. Working distance: Typically 1-3 mm above sample. Field of view: 1-3 mm lateral extent. Image Processing: Real-time display of B-scans. Digital signal processing for dispersion compensation. Segmentation algorithms: Edge detection, thresholding, or machine learning approaches for layer identification. Motion Analysis: Temporal FFT for periodic motion (CBF). Particle tracking algorithms for MCT. Speckle decorrelation analysis alternative method."
Equipment	"μOCT Imaging System: Custom-built or commercial spectral-domain/swept-source OCT. Light source (SLD or swept laser). Interferometer (Michelson or Mach-Zehnder configuration). Spectrometer and line-scan camera (for SD-OCT) or balanced photodetector (for SS-OCT). Scanning optics (galvanometer mirrors). Data Acquisition: High-speed digitizer or frame grabber. Computer workstation for real-time processing and display. Large-capacity storage for image sequences. Culture Maintenance: Incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, humidified) for pre-imaging culture. Temperature-controlled imaging chamber or stage. Humidity control system (sealed chamber or humidified air flow). Calibration: Micron-scale phantom (glass slides, polymer films, or commercial standards). Refractive index reference materials. Analysis Software: Custom MATLAB, Python, or ImageJ-based analysis routines. Segmentation algorithms. FFT libraries for frequency analysis. Statistical analysis package."
Assumptions	"Optical: Refractive index of ASL ~1.33 (aqueous solution); Tissue refractive index ~1.40; Sufficient optical contrast exists at ASL-mucus interface for boundary detection; Optical scattering and absorption do not significantly degrade image quality within imaging depth. Biological: ASL properties in cultured cells reflect in vivo airway surface; Ciliary beat and mucociliary transport continue normally during non-contact imaging; Short imaging duration (<5 min) does not alter ASL volume or composition significantly. Technical: Calibration phantom accurately represents optical path length in biological samples; Motion artifacts from external sources can be minimized or corrected; Temporal resolution sufficient to capture ciliary beat frequency (typically 5-30 Hz); Spatial resolution adequate to resolve ASL layers (typically 5-20 µm height). Functional: ASL depth measured by μOCT correlates with ASL volume; CBF measured in small region represents overall ciliary function; MCT velocity reflects functional mucociliary clearance capacity."
